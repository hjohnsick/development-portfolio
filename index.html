                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Heather Johnsick.  I am a former retail manager turned software engineer.  
                    I completed an intense 3 month coding bootcamp through Grand Circus in Detroit, MI.  
                    Where I learned the fundamentals of C#, ASP.NET, and MySQL.  I am currently employed as a software engineer at Rocket Mortage.  
                    I work primarily in C#, but have some experience in Node.js, Typescript, and Nest.js.  I am currently enrolled in coding bootcamp through MSU where I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, hiking, and kayaking.
